### 7. **Environment Configuration**
- ✅ `config.example.env` with all necessary environment variables
- ✅ Proper separation of frontend and backend configs
- ✅ Modal.com integration setup for AI models

## 🗄️ Database Schema

The application uses a comprehensive Supabase schema with the following tables:

```sql
- profiles              # User profiles with credit balances
- flows                 # Workflow definitions
- executions           # Workflow execution records
- credit_transactions  # Credit purchase/usage history
- flow_attributions    # Revenue sharing and attribution
- scheduled_executions # Future: scheduled workflows
```

## 💳 Credits System

### Pricing Configuration
```typescript
WORKFLOW_PRICING = {
  'cluster-keywords': {
    base_cost: 0.1,
    per_input_cost: 0.001,
    per_output_cost: 0.002,
    model_multiplier: 1.0
  },
  'sentiment-analysis': {
    base_cost: 0.05,
    per_input_cost: 0.0005,
    per_output_cost: 0.001,
    model_multiplier: 1.0
  }
  // ... more workflows
}
```

### Credit Flow
1. New users get 100 free credits
2. Workflow cost calculated based on input size and complexity
3. Credits deducted atomically using Supabase functions
4. Transaction records created for audit trail
5. Execution tracking with status updates

## 🔧 Next Steps to Complete Setup

### 1. **Start Supabase (requires Docker)**
```bash
# Install Docker Desktop if not already installed
# Then run:
cd supabase
npx supabase start
```

### 2. **Set Up Environment Variables**
```bash
# Copy the example config
cp config.example.env .env

# Edit .env with your actual values:
# - Modal API credentials (from your deployment memory)
# - Any additional API keys needed
```

### 3. **Deploy Database Schema**
```bash
# Apply the schema to your Supabase project
cd supabase
npx supabase db push
```

### 4. **Test the Complete Flow**

1. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   cd form-ai-runner
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test signup flow:**
   - Go to signup page
   - Enter email and password
   - Check email for confirmation link
   - Click confirmation link
   - Verify user is created with 100 credits

3. **Test workflow execution:**
   - Sign in with confirmed account
   - Go to keyword clustering workflow
   - Enter sample keywords
   - Verify credit cost calculation
   - Execute workflow
   - Verify credits are deducted
   - Check execution history

### 5. **Connect Real AI Models**

Your Modal deployments from memory:
- Llama 3.3-70B-Instruct
- DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct

Update the backend to call these endpoints:
```typescript
// In executeWorkflowAPI function
const response = await fetch(`${MODAL_ENDPOINT_URL}/your-model-endpoint`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${MODAL_TOKEN}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(inputs)
});
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements Made

- **Real-time credit balance** display
- **Enhanced error handling** with user-friendly messages
- **Password strength indicators** in signup
- **Transaction history** with icons and status
